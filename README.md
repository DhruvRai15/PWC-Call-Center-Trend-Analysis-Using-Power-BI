# PWC-Call-Center-Trend-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

### Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends and patterns in the call center operations of PwC using Power BI. By leveraging the dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to uncover key insights that can inform decision-making, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer service. The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of various metrics such as call volume, handling times, customer satisfaction, and agent performance.

### Insights from the Dashboard

1. **Call Volume Trends:**
   - **Peak Hours:** The dashboard reveals that the call center experiences the highest volume of calls between 10 AM and 2 PM, indicating peak hours where additional staffing may be required.
   - **Daily Patterns:** A noticeable trend shows a higher call volume at the beginning of the week (Monday to Wednesday), with a gradual decline towards the weekend.

2. **Average Handling Time:**
   - **Agent Efficiency:** The data indicates that average handling times vary significantly between agents, highlighting opportunities for targeted training and performance improvement.
   - **Time of Day Impact:** Handling times tend to be longer during peak hours, suggesting that agents might be overwhelmed, and additional resources or support could be beneficial during these periods.

3. **Customer Satisfaction:**
   - **Satisfaction Scores:** Customer satisfaction scores are generally higher during off-peak hours when agents can dedicate more time to each call. This suggests that reducing call volumes during peak hours could positively impact customer satisfaction.
   - **Issue Resolution:** Analysis shows that first-call resolution rates are directly correlated with higher customer satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of resolving issues promptly.

4. **Agent Performance:**
   - **Top Performers:** The dashboard identifies top-performing agents based on key metrics such as call resolution times, customer feedback, and number of calls handled. Recognizing these agents can help in setting benchmarks and sharing best practices.
   - **Training Needs:** Conversely, it also highlights agents who may require additional training and support, ensuring that all team members can perform at their best.

5. **Call Abandonment Rate:**
   - **High Abandonment Periods:** The data shows that call abandonment rates are highest during peak call times, suggesting that long wait times are a significant issue. Implementing strategies to manage call queues or offering callbacks could help reduce these rates.

6. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - **Queue Management:** Insights into call queue lengths and wait times provide valuable information on how to better manage call distribution and agent allocation.
   - **Resource Allocation:** The dashboard suggests that reallocating resources dynamically based on real-time data can help balance the load and improve overall efficiency.

By utilizing these insights, PwC's call center management can make data-driven decisions to enhance operational performance, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation. The Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for ongoing monitoring and strategic planning.
